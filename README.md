## Overview
This project employed two machine learning methods to classify the fashion MNIST dataset:
 
- ML estimation with Gaussian assumption followed by Bayes rule
- K-Nearest-Neighbor  

Two dimensionality reduction techniques are applied on both machine learning methods: 
 
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)

## Dataset

[Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

## Tunable Parameters

### PCA Parameters
- **pca_target_dim:** Using PCA to reduce the data dimension to this number.

### LDA Parameters
- **components_number:** Number of components (< n_classes - 1) for dimensionality reduction.

### KNN Parameters
- **neighbor_num:** Number of neighbors taken into calculation.

### KNN with Different Parameters

- K-Neighbors

![Accuracy vs K Neighbors_scaled](visualization/KNN%20Accuracy%20vs%20K%20Neighbors.png)

*Figure 6. Accuracy and K Number*

From figure 2, it is clear that KNN reaches 100% accuracy on training set when K is set to 1. This is a typical 
overfitting circumstance. When increasing the K number, the accuracy on test set increased slightly and begin to be 
stable after K reaches 7.

### Bayes vs KNN
The gaussian based Bayes classifier is a simple self built class, thus the accuracy maybe lower than the built-in 
classifier from scikit-learn or other libraries.

PCA dimension is set to 30 and LDA set to default in both methods.

Datasets | Bayes Accuracy | KNN Accuracy
-------- | -------------- | ------------ 
LDA Training set | 75.12 % | 87.00 %
PCA Training set | 71.91 % | 88.59 %
LDA Testing set | 73.70 % | 83.06 %
PCA Testing set | 71.58 % | 85.46 %
